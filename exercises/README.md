## Exercises,

In order of difficulty,

1. [Short exercises](https://github.com/burtr/reu-cfs/blob/master/reu-cfs-2023/exercises/python-grab-bag.ipynb)
The first set of programs to undertake. 
3. [Classical Sorting Algorithms](https://github.com/burtr/reu-cfs/blob/master/reu-cfs-2023/exercises/classic-sorting-algorithms.ipynb).
The programs exercise loop invariants.
1. [Connected Graph](https://github.com/burtr/reu-cfs/blob/master/reu-cfs-2023/exercises/connected_graph.ipynb).
Graph algorithm type difficulty.
2. [Perfect shuffles](https://github.com/burtr/reu-cfs-2023/blob/main/exercises/perfect-shuffles.ipynb). Exercise in slices and a notable result in mathematics.
3. [Optimal interval sums](https://github.com/burtr/reu-cfs-2023/blob/main/exercises/interval-sum.ipynb). More practive with slices, and a dynamic programming algorithm.
