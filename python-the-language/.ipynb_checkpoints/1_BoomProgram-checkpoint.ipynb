It allows for swift coding to solve complex problems by automating a large number of house-keeping tasks and by providing high level, semantically meaningfull data-structures natively. It also chooses to be an intepreted language rather than a compiled language, that emphasizes interactive program developement, perhaps at the expense of large scale coding discipline.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 1) Python syntax is that it uses indentation to express logical structure. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many languages are very tolerate of white space, and the layout of a program is dictated by what the community feels provides the best readablity. But the computer does not care about that layout. In Python, layout and program structure are one.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2) Python also makes use of the colon \":\" to set aside parts of control statements. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some states have a head and block following. These are separated by a colon \":\" and in the case of a single statement, it can follow on the same line. Else it introduces an indented block.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3) Single quote and double quotes are equivalent except ...\n",
    "\n",
    "A string literal can be enclosed by either single or double quotes; but single quotes are literals when found inside double quotes, and double quotes are literals when found inside single quotes\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also triple quotes for mutli-line literals, within which line breaks are literal.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no character type; a character is a lenght one string.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4) Variable scope is inferred by certain usage tropes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpreted languages do not require the declaration-before-use of variables. This leaves ambiguous certain scoping situations. If a variable in a block first appears on the left-hand side of an assignment, it becomes a local variable, freshly instantiated for that run-time block. If it first appears on the right-hand side then the lexical scoping rules are invoked to give the variable its binding. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5) Method invocation and the self reference is unusual\n",
    "\n",
    "If a method is invoked on an instance of a class, the usual syntax of `instance.method(arguments)` is actually rewritten as `InstanceClass.method(instance, arguments)`. Honestly, I find it cute.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6) It's all iterators\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has adopted the newer viewpoint of loops in a unified framework of iterators. A compact for of iterator called the _list comprehension_ is provided. A related topic is that of list _slices_ that can appear both on the left and right hand side of assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7) Some datatypes are immutable\n",
    "\n",
    "To enforce common-sense behavior, as well as have everything represented as a class, classes such as string, but others such as pairs, are immutable. References to instances of an immutable class can be distributed without uncertainty of the value.\n"

    "This program counts down and says boom. It is done in four styles,\n",

    "#### Procedural \n",
    "\n",
    "This program demonstrates the iterator `for`. The `range` builtin provides an iterable list of numbers according to start, stop and increment arguments. The stop and increment arguments have defaults. For instance `range(10)` is sufficient to mean `range(0,10,1)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of range is an object of the class [range](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=range#range). It is one among several [iteration types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=range#iterator-types). Other common iteration types are, \n",

    "- [tuples](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=range#tuples), iterating by element in the pair\n",
    "- [dictionaries](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=range#mapping-types-dict), iterating by key, in an order that depends on which Python release\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Object\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes are itroduced by the head with keyword class. The body is the class definition. The reserved method with name `__init__` is the constructor. \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance methods, by convention, put the variable `self` as the first parameter. At runtime it will reference the instance of the class. What would be instance variables in other languages, in Python are variables that begin with `self.` to direct the runtimes attention to the bindings associated with the object instance. In this example, this is demonstrated with the instance variable `self.n`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instance methods are invoked with `instance_ref.method_name(arguments)`, which is rewritten to `instance_class.method_name(instance_ref,arguments)`. The prefix `instance_class` directs the runtime's attention to the bindings associated with the class name, looked up in the currect binding dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recursive\n",
    "\n",
    "As an interpreted language, Python keeps the environment as a stack of dictionaries, the dictionaries containing name, value pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The global dictionary has the name `boom_rec` with value the function body of `boom_rec`, and new dictionaries are pushed onto the stack for each invocaktion of the function; each with a slot for the variable of name `n`. \n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "global dict:(boom_rec, function) &lt;- frame dict-:(n,10) &lt;- ... &lt;- frame dict-:(n,0)\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Generator \n",
    "\n",
    "A function is a generator if the keyword `yield` appears in the function. On first call, a function handle is returned which is a continuation for future invocations of the function. On each subsequent call the continuation is continued until the `yield` and the argument to the yeild is returned as the value, and the continuation updated. An exception is thrown when the function exits.\n"
